DEVELOPMENT OF AN ELEVATOR PROJECT

    In this project I developed a project in which I used Aurix boards and Arduino elements. 
    The goal of this project was to implement an elevator that goes up and down 3 levels controlled by a button.


MEDICAL PREDICTIONS USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS

    The diploma work I did to complete my studies was entitled " Medical predictions using artificial neural networks". 
    The application that I implemented in Matlab has the role of making predictions regarding the risk of developing heart problems.

    Heart problems are of several types such as typical angina, atypical angina and can occur due to the fat that accumulates on the blood vessels of people. 
    The application was implemented in the Matlab development environment using Artificial Neural Networks, Elementary Neurons and some tools offered by this system such as: Neural Net Fitting and App Designer.
